\title{A class definition to store codon coordinates given in the Abelian
group and the codon sequence.}
\description{
An objects from 'CodonSeq' or 'MatrixList' class is returned by
function \code{\link{get_coord}}. This object will store the coordinate of
each sequence in a list of 3D-vectors or a list of vectors located in the
slot named 'CoordList'. The original codon sequence (if provided) will be
stored in the slot named 'SeqRanges'.
