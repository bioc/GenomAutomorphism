\usage{
autm
}
\description{
This is a \code{\link{AutomorphismList}} object carrying a list of pairwise
automorphisms between the DNA sequences from the MSA of primate somatic
cytochrome C. The automorphisms were estimated from the
\code{\link{cyc_aln}} MSA with function from the \code{\link{cyc_aln}}.
